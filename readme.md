It makes colored text from every plain text you give.
**every line** have **different theme color** and you need to use linebreak (enter) every time you want a new color.

## Usage


Words or phrases, if colored and different in each row, are easier to read and less offensive.

Can be used to write a set of vocabulary, or terms and sentences in any subject in English, for learning purposes, and more. One of the uses is at the classroom to write materials for the students and eventually we'll post it in the Document file to them.
